# Interactive Pricing Component

This is my solution to the [Interactive Pricing
Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8)
designed by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I have to build this application using only the preview images and the especifications.

My purpose of completing this challenge was to learn some css and js needed for styling
an input element with a type of range as well... So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Built with:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla JS üç®
- Mobile-First
- Grid/Flexbox

## Notes

I don't think I paid any special attention towards accessibility in this
solution apart from a heading that can be read by screen-readers. I just wanted
to practice some specific basics.
